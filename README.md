Monthly Internship Programm for Professionals (MIIPS) by Coders Ready

1. About the dataset:
Global Terrorism Database is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.

2. Methodology:
In this project we are trying to trace hot zones of terrorism and other security issues with the help of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is a technique that data professionals can be use to understand a datasets before they start to model it.

Q1:As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zones of terrorism.

Around 71% of around 190k terror attacks occurred in the continents of Asia and Africa making them HOT ZONES according to Regions.
Also, 4 of the top 5 countries with the most terrorist attacks (Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India) belong to the continent of Asia (Colombia is in South America). Top 10 countries (Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Colombia, Philippines, Peru, United Kingdom, El Savador and Somalia) contributed to around 55% of the all the terror attacks that happened globally from 1970 to 2018, making them HOT ZONES according to Countries.

3. Conclusion:
Strengthening security across borders and by taking measures on increased immigration in HOT ZONES will also help in controlling Global Terrorism.
Even though attcks are decresing, number are still high that's why this topic should address globally.
